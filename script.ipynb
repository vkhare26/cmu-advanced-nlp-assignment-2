      "Context: have shaped the city physically, economically, and socially Like most older cities, it was the rivers that made the city The rivers allowed for the transport of raw materials and provided water used for making steel, and allowed for easy shipping of finished products Today, the rivers attract mostly recreational boaters, but still support extensive barge traffic Pittsburgh claims to have more bridges than any city in the world (only counting bridges over 20 feet, 440 or so within Pittsburgh, and over 1700 in the county) The hilly landscape—arguably the most rugged of any city east of the Rockies—has created unique neighborhoods; flat lands near the rivers were used for mills, while workers' houses cling precariously to the hillsides above In many places \"pockets\" of neighborhoods, divided by rivers and valleys, have developed distinctly different characteristics from each other, despite being very close together Much of the landscape, with its many unbuildable slopes, remains lush and green, and provides for amazing views Tourist information[edit] Pittsburgh's visitor information centers offer maps, brochures and other information for tourists The VisitPittsburgh website offers more guides and lists of things to do 40.44212-80.003221 Downtown Pittsburgh Info Center (On Liberty Avenue adjacent to Gateway Center, near Point State Park Downtown) M-F 9AM-5PM (Apr-Oct), 9AM-4PM (Nov-Mar); Sa 9AM-5PM; Su 10AM-3PM (updated May 2021) Pittsburgh International Airport Info Center M 9AM-4PM; Tu-F 10AM-5PM; Sa 10AM-6PM; Su 2PM-6PM (updated May 2021) 40.44684-79.992062 Senator John Heinz History Center, 1212 Smallman Street (Strip District) 10AM-5PM (updated May 2021) Climate[edit] Pittsburgh Climate chart (explanation) JFMAMJJASOND 3 36 21 2.6 40 23 3.2 49 30 3.3 62 41 3.8 72 51 4.1 79 59 4.3 83 63 3.5 82 62 3.3 75 55 2.8 63 44 2.9 51 34 2.8 41 27 Average max and min temperatures in °F Precipitation+Snow totals in 12 Connect 12.1 Telephone 12.2 Internet 13 Stay safe 14 Cope 14.1 Newspapers 14.2 Consulates 15 Go next 15.1 Pittsburgh region 15.2 Laurel Highlands 15.3 Further out For other places with the same name, see Pittsburgh (disambiguation) Pittsburgh is a huge city with several district articles that contain information about specific sights, restaurants, and accommodation The pleasure of Pittsburgh remains a well-kept secret Though not built up by reputation, the city's unique combination of bridges, steep hills, and broad rivers make it one of the most naturally scenic cities in the country Cheap food and beer abound in this true sports town and the locals are amazingly friendly A city of about 303,000 (2021) in Allegheny County, at the center of a metro area of about 2.4 million in southwestern Pennsylvania, Pittsburgh is situated at the confluence of three rivers: the Monongahela and Allegheny Rivers, which meet to form the Ohio River The city's unique terrain has resulted in an unusual city design and a hodge-podge of unique neighborhood \"pockets\" with diverse ethnic and architectural heritage Pittsburgh has a rich history and, for its size, an unusual array of cultural treasures, largely thanks to the wealth that was generated when Pittsburgh was a hub of industry Districts[edit] Pittsburgh regions - Color-coded map Downtown The historic, economic, administrative, and cultural center of the city, where the three rivers meet Oakland Home to the city's \"second downtown\" as well as many institutions, museum\n",

      "Context: largest metro area in both the Ohio Valley and Appalachia, the second-largest in Pennsylvania, and the 26th-largest in the U.S Pittsburgh is the principal city of the greater Pittsburgh–Weirton–Steubenville combined statistical area which includes parts of Ohio and West Virginia Pittsburgh is known as \"the Steel City\" for its dominant role in the history of the U.S steel industry.[8] It developed as a vital link of the Atlantic coast and Midwest, as the mineral-rich Allegheny Mountains led to the region being contested by the French and British empires, Virginians, Whiskey Rebels, and Civil War raiders.[9] For part of the 20th century, Pittsburgh was behind only New York City and Chicago in corporate headquarters employment; it had the most U.S stockholders per capita.[10] Deindustrialization in the late 20th century resulted in massive layoffs among blue-collar workers as steel and other heavy industries declined, coinciding with several Pittsburgh-based corporations moving out of the city.[11] However, the city divested from steel and, since the 1990s, Pittsburgh has focused its energies on the healthcare, education, and technology industries.[12][13] Pittsburgh is home to large medical providers, including the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and Allegheny Health Network, as well as 68 colleges and universities, including Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh.[14] The area has served as the federal agency headquarters for cyber defense, software engineering, robotics, energy research, and the nuclear navy.[15] The city is home to ten Fortune 500 companies and seven of the largest 300 U.S law firms Pittsburgh is sometimes called the \"City of Bridges\" for its 446 bridges.[8] Its rich industrial history left the area with renowned cultural institutions, including the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh Zoo & Aquarium, Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens, the National Aviary, and a diverse cultural district.[16] The city's major league professional sports teams Pittsburgh continues to evolve while constantly reminding all who experience it of its rich history From the iconic entrance into the city from the Fort Pitt Tunnel or that first peek at the top of the U.S Steel Tower when I-279 curves, that “particular brand of magic” captivates all who see the Steel City for the first and hundredth time A Look Back at the ‘Burgh In what started as a fort built during the French and Indian War, Pittsburgh earned much of its personality today by once being the center of the American steel industry - it’s where the name of the Steelers came from, after all The grit that came with working in the steel mills can still be felt in the community, from Fairywood to the East Hills A Taste of Pittsburgh If you want to feel integrated as a Pittsburgher, there’s something special about walking through the City’s Strip District on a Steelers Sunday What better way to capture the yinzer spirit than with a Primanti’s sandwich at the original location in the Strip, stacked high with vinegar-based coleslaw, tomatoes, and fries? We recommend, ironically enough, the Pitts-Burger Can’t stomach fries on a sandwich? Then try it on a salad in classic Pittsburgh style It’s good for the soul.Whatever your taste, Pittsburgh has something for everyone Take one of the inclines up Mt Washington and check out the city skyline from the overlooks before stopping for a bite to eat with a view Walk around Butler St to witness the alchemy at local coffee shops, boutiques, independent restaurants and breweries Soon you’ll understand Pittsburgh's particular brand of magic, at once disarming and familiar Lonely Planet Before You Go..

      "Context: arts festival, VIA, the budding renaissance extended outside of the dance music community The multi-day fair, which launched in 2010 and has since become one of the only US members of the ICAS network, takes place across different venues in Pittsburgh during the first week of October and combines musical performances with live avant-garde visual art exhibits According to Leonowicz, until five years ago, many midrange indie artists in various genres skipped over Pittsburgh in favor of Cleveland and Philadelphia “Now we’re in the loop, and that’s great,” he says “The camaraderie between promoters creates a ships-all-rise scenario,” Goshinski adds “Once you get some momentum going, everyone individually benefits.” Although the collaborative mindset among the people involved has helped to create a flourishing scene, there are other factors “One thing that allowed Pittsburgh to flourish the way that is has is the economic situation here,” says Paul Zyla, Clark’s partner at Humanaut “It’s still pretty cheap to live here, and you don’t have to bust your ass to keep yourself going You can make time to make art.” This has allowed a host of new labels and producers to crop up, including the labels Bleepsequence, Stem & Leaf, Broken Planet (the successor to Technoir Audio, the label run by Zyla and Pittsburgh techno demigod Shawn Rudiman), and Detour, as well as artists like Chase Smith and Pittsburgh Track Authority “There’s really good talent here,” Clark affirms “It’s like, OK, you can check off all the boxes now: Pittsburgh has killer parties There are people putting out amazing music You don’t really have a fully-realized scene until you’re making a mark on the overall, global music offerings that are out there, and I think that’s why everyone’s really gotten behind PTA They threw gas on that fire.” The open attitudes towards hoping to catch a star in another city that might offer more opportunity Opinions are split as to whether Pittsburgh is a good or not-so-good town for playwrights, but there are two things on which most agree: There are a lot of them, with enough on- and off-stage talent here to produce high-caliber productions, but not enough of their works are being done A wealth of talent Of the several hundred full-length plays and musicals produced this year in the greater Pittsburgh area, 10 were written by eight local playwrights That's not bad for a city this size, but the numbers may be misleading Artistic directors and governing boards at both large and small houses aren't embracing the local resource - nearly half these writers had to produce their work themselves That's curious considering Pittsburgh's national reputation as a roiling theater melting pot Carnegie Mellon University runs the oldest degree-granting theater program in America and is recognized as one of the leading schools for actors Point Park College's theater-training program is gaining ground Film companies rate the city's technical crews near the top in their field, and one of the best living playwrights uses Pittsburgh as the backdrop to his award-winning plays It's impossible to talk about great American playwrights of the 20th century without citing August Wilson, who has turned memories of his Hill District boyhood into some of the most compelling modern tragedies Theaters that slap Wilson's name on a marquee are bound to draw a crowd, particularly in Pittsburgh But even Wilson didn't become a prophet in his own town until he was first worshiped elsewhere In fact, as a playwright, leaving Pittsburgh seems to have set Wilson free It was when he moved to St Paul, Minn., already in his 30s, that he found his playwriting of theaters in the Cultural District[edit] Benedum Center (formerly the Stanley Theater) Byham Theater (formerly the Gayety Theater, then the Fulton Theater) Harris Theater (formerly Art Cinema) Heinz Hall (formerly Loew's Penn Theater) O'Reilly Theater (newly built in 1999) The August Wilson Center for African American Culture The Cabaret at Theatre Square Bricolage Production Company Pittsburgh Playwrights Theatre Company Visual Arts in the Cultural District[edit] Wood Street Galleries Future Tenant SPACE 707-709 Penn Galleries Watercolors Gallery ToonSeum See also[edit] Theatre in Pittsburgh Theater portalArt portal References[edit] This article includes a list of general references\n",

      "Context: have shaped the city physically, economically, and socially Like most older cities, it was the rivers that made the city The rivers allowed for the transport of raw materials and provided water used for making steel, and allowed for easy shipping of finished products Today, the rivers attract mostly recreational boaters, but still support extensive barge traffic Pittsburgh claims to have more bridges than any city in the world (only counting bridges over 20 feet, 440 or so within Pittsburgh, and over 1700 in the county) The hilly landscape—arguably the most rugged of any city east of the Rockies—has created unique neighborhoods; flat lands near the rivers were used for mills, while workers' houses cling precariously to the hillsides above In many places \"pockets\" of neighborhoods, divided by rivers and valleys, have developed distinctly different characteristics from each other, despite being very close together Much of the landscape, with its many unbuildable slopes, remains lush and green, and provides for amazing views Tourist information[edit] Pittsburgh's visitor information centers offer maps, brochures and other information for tourists The VisitPittsburgh website offers more guides and lists of things to do 40.44212-80.003221 Downtown Pittsburgh Info Center (On Liberty Avenue adjacent to Gateway Center, near Point State Park Downtown) M-F 9AM-5PM (Apr-Oct), 9AM-4PM (Nov-Mar); Sa 9AM-5PM; Su 10AM-3PM (updated May 2021) Pittsburgh International Airport Info Center M 9AM-4PM; Tu-F 10AM-5PM; Sa 10AM-6PM; Su 2PM-6PM (updated May 2021) 40.44684-79.992062 Senator John Heinz History Center, 1212 Smallman Street (Strip District) 10AM-5PM (updated May 2021) Climate[edit] Pittsburgh Climate chart (explanation) JFMAMJJASOND 3 36 21 2.6 40 23 3.2 49 30 3.3 62 41 3.8 72 51 4.1 79 59 4.3 83 63 3.5 82 62 3.3 75 55 2.8 63 44 2.9 51 34 2.8 41 27 Average max and min temperatures in °F Precipitation+Snow totals in 12 Connect 12.1 Telephone 12.2 Internet 13 Stay safe 14 Cope 14.1 Newspapers 14.2 Consulates 15 Go next 15.1 Pittsburgh region 15.2 Laurel Highlands 15.3 Further out For other places with the same name, see Pittsburgh (disambiguation) Pittsburgh is a huge city with several district articles that contain information about specific sights, restaurants, and accommodation The pleasure of Pittsburgh remains a well-kept secret Though not built up by reputation, the city's unique combination of bridges, steep hills, and broad rivers make it one of the most naturally scenic cities in the country Cheap food and beer abound in this true sports town and the locals are amazingly friendly A city of about 303,000 (2021) in Allegheny County, at the center of a metro area of about 2.4 million in southwestern Pennsylvania, Pittsburgh is situated at the confluence of three rivers: the Monongahela and Allegheny Rivers, which meet to form the Ohio River The city's unique terrain has resulted in an unusual city design and a hodge-podge of unique neighborhood \"pockets\" with diverse ethnic and architectural heritage Pittsburgh has a rich history and, for its size, an unusual array of cultural treasures, largely thanks to the wealth that was generated when Pittsburgh was a hub of industry Districts[edit] Pittsburgh regions - Color-coded map Downtown The historic, economic, administrative, and cultural center of the city, where the three rivers meet Oakland Home to the city's \"second downtown\" as well as many institutions, museum\n",

      "Context: largest metro area in both the Ohio Valley and Appalachia, the second-largest in Pennsylvania, and the 26th-largest in the U.S Pittsburgh is the principal city of the greater Pittsburgh–Weirton–Steubenville combined statistical area which includes parts of Ohio and West Virginia Pittsburgh is known as \"the Steel City\" for its dominant role in the history of the U.S steel industry.[8] It developed as a vital link of the Atlantic coast and Midwest, as the mineral-rich Allegheny Mountains led to the region being contested by the French and British empires, Virginians, Whiskey Rebels, and Civil War raiders.[9] For part of the 20th century, Pittsburgh was behind only New York City and Chicago in corporate headquarters employment; it had the most U.S stockholders per capita.[10] Deindustrialization in the late 20th century resulted in massive layoffs among blue-collar workers as steel and other heavy industries declined, coinciding with several Pittsburgh-based corporations moving out of the city.[11] However, the city divested from steel and, since the 1990s, Pittsburgh has focused its energies on the healthcare, education, and technology industries.[12][13] Pittsburgh is home to large medical providers, including the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and Allegheny Health Network, as well as 68 colleges and universities, including Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh.[14] The area has served as the federal agency headquarters for cyber defense, software engineering, robotics, energy research, and the nuclear navy.[15] The city is home to ten Fortune 500 companies and seven of the largest 300 U.S law firms Pittsburgh is sometimes called the \"City of Bridges\" for its 446 bridges.[8] Its rich industrial history left the area with renowned cultural institutions, including the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh Zoo & Aquarium, Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens, the National Aviary, and a diverse cultural district.[16] The city's major league professional sports teams Pittsburgh continues to evolve while constantly reminding all who experience it of its rich history From the iconic entrance into the city from the Fort Pitt Tunnel or that first peek at the top of the U.S Steel Tower when I-279 curves, that “particular brand of magic” captivates all who see the Steel City for the first and hundredth time A Look Back at the ‘Burgh In what started as a fort built during the French and Indian War, Pittsburgh earned much of its personality today by once being the center of the American steel industry - it’s where the name of the Steelers came from, after all The grit that came with working in the steel mills can still be felt in the community, from Fairywood to the East Hills A Taste of Pittsburgh If you want to feel integrated as a Pittsburgher, there’s something special about walking through the City’s Strip District on a Steelers Sunday What better way to capture the yinzer spirit than with a Primanti’s sandwich at the original location in the Strip, stacked high with vinegar-based coleslaw, tomatoes, and fries? We recommend, ironically enough, the Pitts-Burger Can’t stomach fries on a sandwich? Then try it on a salad in classic Pittsburgh style It’s good for the soul.Whatever your taste, Pittsburgh has something for everyone Take one of the inclines up Mt Washington and check out the city skyline from the overlooks before stopping for a bite to eat with a view Walk around Butler St to witness the alchemy at local coffee shops, boutiques, independent restaurants and breweries Soon you’ll understand Pittsburgh's particular brand of magic, at once disarming and familiar Lonely Planet Before You Go..
